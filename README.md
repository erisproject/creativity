# Eris creativity model

This project uses [Eris](https://github.com/erisproject/eris) to model the
creative process, including creation, production, and purchases of copies of a
creative work.

This is primarily modelled as authors, publishers, and readers, but that
terminology is for convenience: the model should be applicable to any sort of
creative output where copies of an original are the marketable good.

## Requirements

- [Eris](https://github.com/erisproject/eris)
- [gtkmm-3.0](http://www.gtkmm.org)
- A C++ compiler supporting the C++11 standard, such as
  [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) (3.3+) or [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (4.9+)
