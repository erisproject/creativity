# Eris creativity model

This project uses [Eris](https://github.com/erisproject/eris) to model the
creative process, including creation, production, and purchases of copies of a
creative work.

This is primarily modelled as authors, publishers, and readers, but that
terminology is for convenience: the model should be applicable to any sort of
creative output where copies of an original are the marketable good.

## Requirements

- [Eris](https://github.com/erisproject/eris)
- [gtkmm-3.0](http://www.gtkmm.org) (optional--required for GUI interface)
- A C++ compiler supporting the C++11 standard, such as
  [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) (3.3+) or [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (4.9+)
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org), including the filesystem and program_options library components.

## Compiling

To compile on a unix-like system, create a new build directory somewhere, then
from this directory run:

    cmake /path/to/creativity
    make -j4

To compile without the GTK GUI, change the cmake line to:

    cmake -DGUI=off /path/to/creativity

You can install directly to the system (usually under /usr/local) using:

    make install

## Debian/Ubuntu packages

Regularly updated library, header, and documentation packages are available for
amd64 systems by adding one of the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:

    deb https://imaginary.ca/debian jessie main
    deb https://imaginary.ca/debian sid main
    deb https://imaginary.ca/ubuntu trusty main
    deb https://imaginary.ca/ubuntu wily main

The first is for debian stable; the second for debian testing and unstable; the
last two are for the referenced Ubuntu releases.

The required key signature for package verification can be installed using:

    curl -s https://imaginary.ca/public.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

The 'creativity' package contains the command-line tools, the 'creativity-gui' package includes
the graphical simulation interface.
