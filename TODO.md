# TODO

This file outlines items that are planned for incorporation into the code in
the future.  This is mainly meant as a dumping ground for ideas so that the
ideas aren't forgotten along the way.

Currently, the public tracker takes a lump sum amount of a constant size each
period.  It would be better to have an optimizing public tracker here that
attempts to find the amount that maximizes long-term aggregate utility.
