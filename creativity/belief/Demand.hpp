/** This class represents an author's belief about the per-period demand for books.  The model is of
 * the form:
 *
 * \f$Q_b = \beta_0 + \beta_1 P_b + \beta_2 q_b + \beta_3 prevSales + \beta_4 nosales + u\f$
 * where:
 * - \f$Q_b\f$ is the quantity (i.e. copies) demanded
 * - \f$P_b\f$ is the price of a copy (which must be non-negative)
 * - \f$q_b\f$ is the quality of the work, determined when the work is created, which must be
 *   non-negative.  Readers observe either a draw based on this, or a predicted quality.
 * - \f$prevSales\f$ is the number of copies sold in previous periods
 * - \f$nosales\f$ is the number of periods the book has gone without sales
 * - \f$marketBooks\f$ is the number of books on the market in the previous period
 *
 * The following restrictions are imposed on beliefs:
 * - \f$\beta_1 \leq -0.05\f$ (demand curve is downward sloping (at least for sufficiently small p))
 * - \f$\beta_2 \geq 0\f$ (higher quality means more sales (at least for low quality))
 * - \f$\beta_4 \leq -1\f$ (each no sales period decreases quantity demanded by at least 1)
 *
 * These constraints are combined with a natural conjugate prior for the purposes of updating the
 * beliefs via Bayesian econometrics.
 *
 * Additionally, when predicting, readers know that Q can never be larger than the number of readers
 * in the world minus the copies already sold, and incorporate this limitation into predictions.
