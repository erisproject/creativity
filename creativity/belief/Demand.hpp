/** This class represents an author's belief about the per-period demand for books.  The model is of
 * the form:
 *
 * \f$Q_b = \beta_0 + \beta_1 P_b + \beta_2 q_b + \beta_3 q_b^2 + \beta_4 S_{b-} + \beta_5 S_{nosales}
 * + \beta_6 new + \beta_7 age + \beta_8 onlyBook + \beta_9 otherBooks + \beta_{10} marketBooks + u\f$
 * where:
 * - \f$Q_b\f$ is the quantity (i.e. copies) sold
 * - \f$P_b\f$ is the price of a copy (which must be non-negative)
 * - \f$q_b\f$ is the quality of the work, determined when the work is created, which must be
 *   non-negative.
 * - \f$S_{b-}\f$ is the number of copies sold in previous periods
 * - \f$new\f$ is a dummy which is 1 for a new book (\f$age = 0\f$), 0 otherwise.
 * - \f$S_{nosales}\f$ is a dummy which is true if the book was on the market in the previous period
 *   but had no sales.  (It is 0 for new books).
 * - \f$age\f$ is the age of the book, in simulation periods, starting from 0.
 * - \f$onlyBook\f$ is a dummy: 1 if this is the creator's only work, 0 if the creator has other
 *   works.  (Note that this can change during a book's lifetime.)
 * - \f$otherBooks\f$ is the number of other books the author has created.  (Note that this can
 *   change during a book's lifetime.)
 * - \f$marketBooks\f$ is the number of books on the market in the previous period
 *
 * The following restrictions are imposed on beliefs:
 * - \f$\beta_1 \leq -0.05\f$ (demand curve is downward sloping (at least for sufficiently small p))
 * - \f$\beta_2 \geq 0\f$ (higher quality means more sales (at least for low quality))
 * - \f$\beta_3 \leq 0\f$ (quality increase effect is concave)
 * - \f$\beta_5 \leq 0\f$ (no sales last period means less demand)
 *
 * \f$\beta_9 \leq 0\f$ seems an intuitive restriction, but isn't imposed because we actually use
 * lagged market size, not current market size, because lagged market size is all the reader has
 * when doing demand prediction.  Positive values aren't entirely possible there, in particular if
 * the market exhibits cyclical behaviour.
 *
 * These constraints are combined with a natural conjugate prior for the purposes of updating the
 * beliefs via Bayesian econometrics.
 *
 * Additionally, when predicting, readers know that Q can never be larger than the number of readers
 * in the world minus the copies already sold, and incorporate this limitation into predictions.
