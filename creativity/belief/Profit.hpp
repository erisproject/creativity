/** This class represents an author's belief about the lifetime profitability of a work.  The model
 * is:
 *
 * \f$\pi_b = \beta_0 + \beta_1 q_b + \beta_2 q_b^2 + \beta_3 marketBooks + u\f$
 *
 * Specifically, the fields above are:
 * - \f$\pi_b\f$ is the lifetime profits of the book *without* considering the initial creation effort
 * - \f$q_b\f$ is the (non-negative) quality of the book.
 * - \f$marketBooks\f$ is the number of books on the market in the previous period (books in the
 *   current period can't be used because it is unknown at the time the reader is making the
 *   decision of whether or not to create).
 *
 * Although a \f$\beta_3 \leq 0\f$ restriction would make some intuitive sense (more competition
 * means lower profit), it isn't imposed because doing so induces volatile creation cycles: readers decide
 * to create in low-book periods, which results in an immediate surge in on-market books, which
 * induces readers to not create in the next period, and so on.  Not imposing it still often has it
 * be significant for many readers, but seems to avoid the strong behavioural cycles.
 *
 * The model uses a natural conjugate prior for the purposes of updating the beliefs via Bayesian
 * econometrics.
